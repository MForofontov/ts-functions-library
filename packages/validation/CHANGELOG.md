# Changelog - @ts-utilkit/validation

All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- `validateConfig`: reject `null`/`undefined` config instead of returning `true`.
- `isValidISODate`: validate date-only strings with UTC components to avoid false negatives in negative-offset timezones.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Remove all runtime `typeof`/`instanceof` TypeError guards; rely on TypeScript type system for type safety
- Remove all `@throws {TypeError}` JSDoc tags from all affected functions
- Remove all TypeError test cases from all test files
- `isValidRegex`: `catch (e)` → `catch` as the caught error is not referenced in the handler body
- Apply Prettier formatting: remove orphaned blank lines at function-body openings introduced by guard removal

- Add `exports` field to `package.json` for explicit ESM/CJS/types entry-point resolution by modern bundlers and Node.js `exports` map

### Added

- New function `validateConfig` - Validates configuration object against required keys schema (migrated from deprecated @ts-utilkit/configuration package)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added

- Initial release of @ts-utilkit/validation with 9 functions
- Network validation: `isValidIPv4`, `isValidIPv6`, `isValidMACAddress`, `isValidUUID`
- Data validation: `isValidJSON`, `isValidISODate`, `isValidTime`
- Pattern validation: `isValidPattern`

## Workflow

As you make changes, immediately add them to the **[Unreleased]** section:

1. Add item under appropriate category (Added/Changed/Fixed/Deprecated/Removed/Security)
2. When releasing, rename [Unreleased] to version number with date
3. Create new empty [Unreleased] section at the top
