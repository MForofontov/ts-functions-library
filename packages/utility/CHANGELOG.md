# Changelog - @ts-utilkit/utility

All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-29

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `rgbToHex` now throws if any channel is missing, NaN, or non-finite (previously could emit `#ffNaNNaN`-style strings).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Remove all runtime `typeof`/`instanceof` TypeError guards; rely on TypeScript type system for type safety
- Remove all `@throws {TypeError}` JSDoc tags from all affected functions
- Remove all TypeError test cases from all test files
- `bytesToSize`: delegate implementation to `formatBytes` from `@ts-utilkit/format`; behaviour unchanged (IEC units in binary mode, 2 decimal places)
- `bytesToSize`: marked `@deprecated` — use `formatBytes` from `@ts-utilkit/format` directly; will be removed in the next major version
- Apply Prettier formatting: remove orphaned blank lines at function-body openings introduced by guard removal

- Add `exports` field to `package.json` for explicit ESM/CJS/types entry-point resolution by modern bundlers and Node.js `exports` map
- Pin `@ts-utilkit/format` dependency from `*` to `^0.2.0`

### Deprecated

- `isNil`: thin wrapper over `value === null || value === undefined` — use `value == null` or an explicit null-check directly
- `bytesToSize`: pure delegate to `formatBytes` from `@ts-utilkit/format` with no added logic — use `formatBytes` directly

### Added

- Declare `@ts-utilkit/format` as an explicit package dependency
- Add `memoize` function to cache synchronous function results with optional custom key serialisation (sync counterpart to `asyncMemoize`)
- Add `pipe` function for left-to-right function composition with full TypeScript overloads up to 6 functions
- Add `compose` function for right-to-left function composition with full TypeScript overloads up to 6 functions
- Add `tryCatch` function for safe synchronous execution returning `{ value, error }` without propagating exceptions
- Add `measure` function to time synchronous function execution returning `{ result, durationMs, label }`

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-26

### Added

- Initial release of @ts-utilkit/utility with 10 functions
- Function timing control: `debounce`, `throttle`, `once`
- Number utilities: `clamp`
- Color conversion: `hexToRgb`, `rgbToHex`
- Type checking: `isNil`
- UUID generation: `uuid`
- Random utilities: `randomBoolean`
- No-op function: `noop`
- TypeScript-first with complete type definitions
- Comprehensive test coverage (>95%)

## Workflow

As you make changes, immediately add them to the **[Unreleased]** section:

1. Add item under appropriate category (Added/Changed/Fixed/Deprecated/Removed/Security)
2. When releasing, rename [Unreleased] to version number with date
3. Create new empty [Unreleased] section at the top
