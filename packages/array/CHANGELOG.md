# Changelog - @ts-utilkit/array

All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-29

### Changed

- Dependency `@ts-utilkit/object` bumped to `^0.3.0` (compatible with object 0.3.x).
- `exports` field: `types` condition listed first for better TypeScript resolution.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Remove all runtime `typeof`/`instanceof` TypeError guards; rely on TypeScript type system for type safety
- Remove all `@throws {TypeError}` JSDoc tags from all affected functions
- Remove all TypeError test cases from all test files
- `findMax`: replace `Math.max(...arr)` spread (stack overflow risk for arrays > ~100k elements) with a `reduce`-based implementation that preserves NaN propagation semantics
- `findMin`: replace `Math.min(...arr)` spread (stack overflow risk for arrays > ~100k elements) with a `reduce`-based implementation that preserves NaN propagation semantics
- `groupBy`: replaced with a pure `export { groupByObject as groupBy }` re-export from `@ts-utilkit/object`; eliminates all duplicated logic
- `findCommonWithCondition`: replace `JSON.stringify(item1) === JSON.stringify(item2)` with `deepEqual` from `@ts-utilkit/object` — correctly handles NaN, Date, RegExp, and deeply nested values that JSON.stringify cannot
- Apply Prettier formatting: remove orphaned blank lines at function-body openings introduced by guard removal

- Add `exports` field to `package.json` for explicit ESM/CJS/types entry-point resolution by modern bundlers and Node.js `exports` map
- Pin `@ts-utilkit/object` dependency from `*` to `^0.2.0`

### Deprecated

- `groupBy`: re-export of `groupByObject` from `@ts-utilkit/object`; use `groupByObject` directly
- `generatePrimes`: moved to `@ts-utilkit/math` where it belongs as a number theory function; kept here with @deprecated for backward compatibility

### Added

- Add `countBy` — group array elements by a key function and return a `Map<string, number>` of occurrence counts
- Add `dropWhile` — drop leading elements while a predicate holds, returning all remaining elements
- Add `partition` — split an array into `[matches, nonMatches]` tuple based on a predicate
- Add `slidingWindow` — generate all contiguous sub-arrays of a fixed size across the input array
- Add `takeWhile` — collect leading elements while a predicate holds, stopping at first failure
- Declare `@ts-utilkit/object` as an explicit package dependency (formalises existing cross-package import)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-26

### Added

- Initial release of @ts-utilkit/array with 26 functions
- Array manipulation utilities: `arrayDifference`, `arrayIntersection`, `cartesianProduct`, `chunkArray`
- Filtering and searching: `findCommonWithCondition`, `findDuplicates`, `findIndexOfElement`, `findMax`, `findMin`, `findUniqueElements`
- Flattening utilities: `flattenArray`, `flattenArrayDepth`
- Prime number generation: `generatePrimes`
- Grouping and aggregation: `groupBy`, `uniqueElementsWithCounts`
- String operations: `joinStrings`
- Array combination: `mergeUnique`, `zipMultiple`
- Element removal: `removeByCondition`, `removeByIndex`, `removeDuplicates`, `removeFalsyValues`
- Array rotation: `rotateArrayLeft`, `rotateArrayRight`
- Sorting utilities: `sortBy`
- Mathematical operations: `sumArrayElements`
- TypeScript-first with complete type definitions
- Comprehensive test coverage (>95%)
- Tree-shakeable ESM and CommonJS support

## Workflow

As you make changes, immediately add them to the **[Unreleased]** section:

1. Add item under appropriate category (Added/Changed/Fixed/Deprecated/Removed/Security)
2. When releasing, rename [Unreleased] to version number with date
3. Create new empty [Unreleased] section at the top
